# QuoteGenerator
This is a simple web app that displays random quotes each time the user clicks a button.
The Random Quote Generator is a dynamic and interactive project crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The core concept revolves around the idea that a single quote has the power to reshape our thoughts and spark positive change. 
It's a great way to get a dose of inspiration and motivation.
By presenting users with a new quote upon each button press, the application encourages moments of introspection, self-improvement, and personal growth.
